# AI-Powered Hydroponics: Maximizing Plant Growth with Intelligence

Harness the potential of Hydroponics, powered by Artificial Intelligence.

## Introduction

Welcome to the future of agriculture â€” where the synergy of Hydroponics and AI revolutionizes plant cultivation. Hydroponics replaces traditional soil with a nutrient-rich water solution, enabling plants to thrive in a controlled environment. Our project takes this concept further, introducing AI to monitor and optimize environmental conditions, In this project, we dive deep into Hydroponics, combining it with AI for leaf counting and predictive insights into plant height.

## Objectives

- Collect data about the plant for research and development purposes.
- Establish a relation between plant growth and parameters under which it is growing.
- Decision model to predict the height of basil plant using OpenAG dataset.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Hydroponic System:** Utilizes Polyvinyl Chloride pipes with sealed ends, deploying the Deep Water Culture method for plant growth.
- **Precision Control:** Monitors and adjusts environmental factors like pH, electrical conductivity, light intensity, and more using AI.
- **Nutrient Solution:** Precisely formulated nutrient solution determined through Hydrobuddy.
- **Predictive AI:** Implements machine learning models (Linear Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron) to forecast plant height at various stages.
